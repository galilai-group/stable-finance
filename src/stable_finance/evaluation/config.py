"""Every decision between a forward-return forecast and a Sharpe ratio.

A Sharpe ratio is not a property of a forecast. It is a property of a forecast
plus a trading harness, and the harness contributes decisions the model being
evaluated has no opinion about: which names are tradable, how much of the
cross-section to hold, how risk is forecast, how weights follow from it, how
often to rebalance, what a trade costs, and how a periodic return is
annualized. This module makes that harness an explicit, enumerable object.

There is a DEFAULT so that the common case is one call and the library has an
opinion. There is a config SPACE so that the sensitivity of a result to the
harness can be measured rather than assumed, which is the only way to tell a
finding about a model from a finding about a backtest.

#: The execution qualities swept, as EFQ (effective / quoted half-spread).
#: 0 is a midpoint fill and 1 pays the whole quoted spread; 0.55 and 0.88 are
#: Levy (2022)'s measured direct-market-access and NYSE figures, and 0.70 sits
#: between them. EFQ REPLACES the old ``cost_model`` sweep as the cost axis,
#: because it is one continuous measured quantity rather than five named
#: models, and because a result reported against it can be read by anyone who
#: knows their own execution.

#: How a periodic return series is annualized. ``decisions`` treats every
#: decision as an independent period, which for an intraday anchor grid
#: annualizes a signal that is in the market for part of the session as though
#: it were in the market all year; ``daily`` first sums each day's decisions
#: into one daily return and annualizes at 252. Neither is wrong, they answer
#: different questions, and the gap between them is large enough that leaving
#: it implicit would be the mistake.
ANNUALIZATIONS = ("decisions", "daily")

#: When the book is allowed to change. ``every_decision`` re-solves at every
#: anchor; ``daily`` sets the book at each day's first decision and holds it,
#: which cuts turnover by roughly the number of anchors in a day and is the
#: difference between a signal that pays for its spread and one that does not.
#: ``horizon`` sets the book once per forecast horizon (restarting each day),
#: holds it for the horizon, and books its forward return ONCE: the way to
#: score an h-horizon forecast on a grid of decisions closer together than h,
#: where booking every decision's forward return counts each move about
#: h / spacing times. The harness reads the horizon from the forecast and the
#: spacing from the decisions.
REBALANCE_RULES = ("every_decision", "daily", "horizon")

#: holds each name at its weight: every decision's book is a fresh bet that

#: cross-sectional book retraded every decision, and how every earlier result
#: was scored. ``drift`` holds what was bought: a position moves with its own
#: return between decisions (h -> h (1 + r)), so a trade held across several
#: decisions earns exactly its price change, and an order goes out only when
#: the target CHANGES (or an earlier order is still unfilled) -- an unchanged
#: target is held, not rebalanced back. ``drift`` needs the realized returns
#: to run from each decision to the NEXT one; horizons that overlap the next
