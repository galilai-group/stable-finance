# stable-finance

Composable evaluation for financial representations, forecasts, portfolios,
and orders. **Every stage is an injection point.** Bring your own embeddings,
return forecasts (`y_hat`), portfolio weights, or orders; stable-finance only
runs the downstream adapters and metrics you ask for.

```text
embeddings -> forward returns -> portfolio weights -> orders
     |               |                 |              |
     +------ IC -----+                 +---- Sharpe ---+
```

The package follows scikit-learn's estimator vocabulary: adapters expose
`fit(X, y)` and `predict(X)`, constructor arguments are inspectable
hyperparameters, and the fitted object is reusable. The first migration slice
provides:

- explicit, validated contracts for embeddings, forward returns, and portfolio
  weights;
- a standardized ridge probe from embeddings to forward-return forecasts;
- cross-sectional Spearman information coefficient at each decision time and
  forecast horizon;
- annualized portfolio Sharpe marked at mid;
- annualized portfolio Sharpe after crossing the observable best-bid/best-ask
  spread; and
- weight backtesting with quoted half-spread costs and multiple horizons.

The contracts use dense arrays with shape
`(decision time, asset, horizon)`. Decisions, assets, and horizons are carried
alongside every array and alignment is checked before evaluation. NaN denotes
a missing observation.

```python
import stable_finance as sf

# Enter at embeddings: fit the default adapter, then produce y_hat.
probe = sf.fit(train_embeddings, train_returns, alpha=1.0)
forecast = probe.predict(test_embeddings)

# Enter at y_hat: skip fitting and evaluate forecasts directly.
information_coefficients = sf.evaluate_forward_returns(forecast, test_returns)
```

`RidgeProbe` is also a scikit-learn estimator, so users who want explicit
composition can instantiate, inspect, clone, fit, and predict with it directly.
Stable-finance does not transform the supplied target: a fit against raw
returns learns raw returns; a fit against cross-sectional z-scores learns those
z-scores. Choosing or estimating the target transform is a separate pipeline
stage rather than hidden probe behavior.

The portfolio metrics report the frictionless mid-price result and the
executable quoted-spread result separately. The latter executes positive
weight changes at the best ask and negative weight changes at the best bid:

```python
from stable_finance import cross_spread_sharpe, mid_price_sharpe

# Enter at weights: no forecast model or allocator is required.
mid = mid_price_sharpe(weights, realized_mid_returns)
crossed = cross_spread_sharpe(
    weights, realized_mid_returns, best_bid, best_ask
)
```

In the originating market-jepa setup, the default for supervised training,
ridge fitting, and evaluation is the empirical-uniform target within each
same-date, same-anchor cross-section:

```text
uniform_i(t, h) = rankdata(y_cell)_i / (n_cell + 1)
```

Ties receive their average rank. Gaussian rank, ordinary cross-sectional
z-score `(y - mean) / std`, and raw returns remain explicit alternatives. The
ridge estimator never changes the supplied target; the stable-finance dataset
layer computes the representations explicitly and the caller chooses one.

The dataset layer can expose all four representations together, so choosing a
loss target does not discard information or push preprocessing into model
code:

```python
targets = stats.transform(raw, date, anchor, target_types, horizons)
model_target = targets.select("uniform")       # default
all_target_metadata = targets.as_dict()        # raw/zscore/uniform/rank
```

## Dataset architecture

The supported input is the Polygon-derived one-second US-equity dataset. Its
column semantics, exchange sessions, sparse-to-dense reconstruction, and
single-session contract live in `stable_finance.dataset`. MosaicML Streaming is
the v1 storage backend:

```bash
uv sync --extra mds
```

```python
from stable_finance.dataset.mds import StreamingMarketDataset

train = StreamingMarketDataset.from_month(mosaic_dir, "2020-01")
```

Storage is kept behind a backend-neutral `MarketSession`. A later LanceDB
backend can therefore produce the same object. Sessions retain explicit date
boundaries so a future multi-day framer can insert learned open and close
tokens without changing storage or target APIs.

View geometry is configuration. `ViewSpec()` records the current 2,048-token,
50–100% of session recipe; sequence length, scale range, resolution range,
anchor grid, and future slack are hyperparameters rather than dataset schema.

A model integration may implement `MonthlyProbeData`, allowing the existing
probe to be fit with `RidgeProbe().fit_month("2020-01", source)` while keeping
checkpoint and encoder concerns outside this repository.

## Development

Use `uv` exclusively:

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

## Migration plan

1. Establish stage contracts and metric semantics.
2. Add the ridge adapter from embeddings to forward-return forecasts.
3. Add covariance estimation and a mean-variance adapter from forecasts to
   weights.
4. Add an order/fill contract and bid/ask execution simulator.
5. Expose serialized evaluation results through a small visualization app.

Research-specific checkpoint loading, target construction, and training remain
in `market-jepa`; they should depend on this package's public contracts rather
than being copied into it.
